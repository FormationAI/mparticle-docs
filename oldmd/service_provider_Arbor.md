## Arbor

Arbor operates the first marketplace for people-based data. Publishers and app developers are empowered to surface, value, and fully monetize their match and location data asset in a privacy-friendly, transparent manner

By working with Arbor, events with location coordinates and/or log-in information (hashed email addresses) will be made available to a marketplace of buyers, although the identity of your app will remain private. Arbor will then provide revenue earned and detailed reporting.
