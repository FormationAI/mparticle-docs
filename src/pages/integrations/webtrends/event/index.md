## Data Processing Notes

mParticle has observed that it may take up to 12 hours for data sent from mParticle to appear in Webtrends.

## Prerequisites

In order to enable mParticleâ€™s integration with Webtrends, you will need to login to your Webtrends Analytics 10 account, create a space to get the DCSID - a unique identifier that associates the data collected from a website or app with a space or profile in Analytics 10.  To obtain the DCSID, click on the space from the Spaces dashboard and then click the info icon in the upper right corner to display the space details.

If you want to send data to Webtrends Streams, please work with your Webtrends account manager to enabled this feature before enabling the "Send to Webtrends Streams" setting.

## Event Data Mapping

You can add Custom Flags to your events, which will be mapped to Webtrends schema as described below.

~~~objectivec
MPEvent *event = [[MPEvent alloc] initWithName:@"Set Title"
                                          type:MPEventTypeUserPreference;

[event addCustomFlag:@"Test Title"
             withKey:@"Webtrends.EventDescription"];

[[MParticle sharedInstance] logEvent:event];
~~~


~~~java
MPEvent event = new MPEvent.Builder("Set Title", MParticle.EventType.UserPreference)
                .addCustomFlag("Webtrends.EventDescription", "Test Title")
                .build();
MParticle.getInstance().logEvent(event);
