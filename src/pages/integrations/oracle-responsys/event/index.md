Oracleâ€™s B2C Cross-Channel Marketing solution, [Oracle Responsys](https://docs.oracle.com/cloud/latest/marketingcs_gs/responsys.html) provides marketing teams with a centralized canvas to build specific consumer profiles and tailor interactions for consumers across email, mobile, display, and social channels.

mParticle's Response integration supports two different Responsys products - the core Responsys product and the Push.io product. Responsys is typically used to drive email marketing campaigns whereas Push.io is geared towards push notification delivery and display. The configuration steps are specific for each product so be sure to reference the correct guide below.

## Responsys Event

mParticle's Oracle Responsys integration helps drive personalization for marketing campaigns. The Event integration can be used on its own or in conjunction with the audience integration to add additional context (user specific attributes, links to product fields, event attributes, and much more) to Responsys campaigns.

#### Example Use Cases


1. Target users who have performed specific actions like "Abandon Cart" or "Viewed Product."
2. Personalize user emails with user attributes like name, address, and activate across a number of different channels using other identifiers. 
3. Drive higher email engagement by using event data to populate action context details including product fields, prices, and discounts.

### Prerequisites

This guide is meant to be complemented by Oracle's own step-by-step guides. 

1. Grab your Responsys credentials from your Responsys Account:
    - username
    - password
    - Endpoint API URL
2. Create three tables in Responsys:
   - Event Table 
   - Commerce Table
   - User Table 

- Tables can be created through the UI or via the Responsys API.
- You will need the names of these tables when configuring the mParticle connection. 

The tables must contain the following data schema (column names are case sensitive):

## Responsys Events for Push.io

mParticle's Oracle Responsys integration is an embedded kit integration for the iOS and Android platforms.

### Prerequisites

This guide is meant to be complemented by Oracle's own Step-by-step guides which you can reference here:

- [Android](https://docs.oracle.com/cloud/latest/marketingcs_gs/OMCFB/android/step-by-step/)
- [iOS](https://docs.oracle.com/cloud/latest/marketingcs_gs/OMCFB/ios/)

### Retrieve your Oracle Responsys Settings

In order to enable mParticle's integration with Oracle Responsys, you will need to download a configuration file for your app from the Oracle Responsys dashboard. Each platform/environment has its own configuration file. For example, if you want to set up both iOS and Android kits, in development and production, you will need to download four configuration files.

1. From the **Manage Apps** page, select your app and navigate to the **Platform** page in the left column.
2. For each platform you want to enable, click the download icon and select either `pushio_config.json` (Production) or `pushio_config_debug.json` (Development).
   ![](/images/oracle-responsys-push-config.png)

<aside>With mParticle's Oracle integration, you will not include these configuration files in your app. Instead, the settings in these files must be copied into the mParticle dashboard setup for your iOS or Android workspace.</aside>

Reference the [configuration](#configuration-settings) and [connection](#connection-settings) settings below when creating the connection for your mParticle workspace.

While configuring select the "Use Embedded Kit" for the Push.io endpoint. 


### Add the Kit and Oracle SDK

mParticle's Oracle Responsys integration requires that you add the Oracle Responsys Kit to your iOS or Android app. Oracle differs from other kit integrations in that **you must manually download their SDK binary** and add it to your app, in addition to the respective iOS/Android kits.

Reference the [Apple SDK](/developers/sdk/ios/kits/) and [Android SDK](/developers/sdk/android/kits/) guides to read more about kits and making direct-calls to underlying kit SDKs.

#### Android

mParticle publishes the Oracle Responsys Kit as an Android library which has a transitive dependency on mParticle's core Android SDK. You are additionally required to manually download the Oracle SDK `.aar` file and add it to your app.

#### 1. Add the kit dependency

~~~groovy
// Sample build.gradle
// Add the kit dependency
dependencies {
    // Ensure the Kit version matches that of the mParticle Core SDK that you're using
    implementation 'com.mparticle:android-responsys-kit:5+'

    //You will also need to add the PushIOManager.aar binary to your app, see below
    implementation fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['PushIOManager.aar'])
}
~~~

#### 2. Download the Oracle SDK

Please reference the [Oracle Android SDK guide](https://docs.oracle.com/cloud/latest/marketingcs_gs/OMCFB/android/) for a link to download the Oracle Push IO Manager SDK and include it in your app's `libs` directory.

The Android Responsys Kit has been verified against **version 6.39** of the Oracle/PushIOManager SDK.

### iOS

The Oracle Responsys SDK used by the mParticle integration is not available via Cocoapods or Carthage, so at this time the SDK as well as the kit must be manually downloaded.

1. Follow the [Oracle Responsys iOS guide](https://docs.oracle.com/cloud/latest/marketingcs_gs/OMCFB/ios/) to add the necessary `.PEM` and download the Push IO Manager SDK and add it to your project.
2. [Navigate to the kit repository](https://github.com/mparticle-integrations/mparticle-apple-integration-responsys/tree/master/mParticle-Responsys) and download the last source code for `MPKitResponsys.h` and `MPKitResponsys.m`, and add them both to your project.

### Dashboard Setup

From here you're ready to finish configuring and begin testing the integration. See the [mParticle Platform Guide](https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/connections/) to review how to create a new configuration and connection for your workspace.
