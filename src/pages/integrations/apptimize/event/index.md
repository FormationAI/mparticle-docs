Apptimize allows iOS and Android teams to make real-time updates to the native app experience and data-driven product decisions. Teams can A/B test user flows, control feature rollouts, make instant UI changes, and more.

## Supported Features

A/B Testing

## Prerequisites

## Apptimize Kit Integration

mParticle's Apptimize integration requires that you add the Apptimize kit to your iOS or Android app, and the mParticle SDK will initialize and automatically map mParticle method calls directly onto Apptimize method calls. This approach means that **every feature of the Apptimize SDKs are supported**, as if the app had integrated Apptimize directly. The source code for each kit is available if you would like to learn exactly how the method mapping occurs:

- [iOS](https://github.com/mparticle-integrations/mparticle-apple-integration-apptimize)
- [Android](https://github.com/mparticle-integrations/mparticle-android-integration-apptimize)

Add the Apptimize Kit to your iOS or Android app. For the Android kit, you must also add Aptimize's Maven repository to your `build.gradle`. See the Cocoapods and Gradle examples below, and reference the [Apple SDK](https://github.com/mParticle/mparticle-apple-sdk) and [Android SDK](https://github.com/mParticle/mparticle-android-sdk) GitHub pages to read more about kits.
