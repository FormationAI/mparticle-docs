Kochava provides a platform to help advertisers better manage user acquisition, optimization, and analysis.

## Input Data Details

The following types of data can be configured to be sent from Kochava to mParticle

* Attribution

If the Configured Postback type is "Install", this is converted to an install attribution event.

* Event Type = Custom Event
* Custom Event Type = attribution
* Event Name = attribution

Install attribution events update the original attribution information stored against the user profile. 

If the Configured Postback type is "not-Install", it is sent as configured in Kochava.

In order to avoid event duplication, mParticle automatically drops Postbacks from Kochava where the `attribution_type` is Install and `event_name` is not Install.

* Event Type = Custom Event
* Custom Event Type = attribution
* Event Name = [event name] from Kochava

All attributes included in the Postback are set as custom attributes:

* publisher
* campaign
* attribution_type - install/reengagement
* event_name - provided by Kochava
* any configured event attributes 


See mParticle's [JSON attribution custom events reference](/developers/server/json-reference/#attribution-custom-events) for more information.



### Install versus Re-engagement

Currently, in the Kochava interface, you will create "Configured Postbacks". Configured Postbacks consist of Install and all other Postback types. 

When an advertiser creates a campaign in Kochava, they can designate the campaign as an [install campaign](https://support.kochava.com/campaign-management/create-an-install-campaign/) which converts on new installs only or a [re-engagement campaign](https://support.kochava.com/campaign-management/create-a-reengagement-campaign/) which converts on a post install event of the advertiserâ€™s choosing.

There is no concept of a re-engagement postback. However, if a user (existing or new) clicks on an ad with a click URL from a re-engagement campaign and then proceeds to complete the designated conversion action, the postback for that event would contain `attribution_type=reengagement`.

All metadata will be sent to mParticle. If there are parameters outside of the event metadata - from the click, for example, that you are trying to send to mParticle, Kochava will need more information about what you're looking for and how that metadata is being sent to Kochava. 

If there are other fields that you would like to use, please contact your mParticle Customer Success Manager.
