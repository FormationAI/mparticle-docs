Xandr Invest is the exclusive buy-side platform for Community, Xandrâ€™s curated, premium video marketplace.

## Prerequisites

 The only thing you'll need in order to activate our Xandr audience integration is your Member ID, which you can obtain from your Xandr support representative.  As a Xandr Audience Integration, we utilize our own Xandr account to synchronize audience data between our platforms, and share the synchronized audiences with your Xandr account via the Sharing API.

## User Identity Mapping

When forwarding audience data to Xandr, mParticle will send IDFAs, Google Advertising IDs, MD5 and SHA-1 of Android Device IDs. If you have enabled a [cookie sync](/integrations/Xandr/cookie-sync/) integration with Xandr, mParticle will also forward Xandr User IDs for your Web users where available.

## Upload Frequency

The Xandr Integration uses Bulk Forwarding. Bulk Forwarding means that, instead of uploading updates to an audience in real time, mParticle compiles updates into a queue until either a given amount of time has passed since the last upload, or until a certain number of updates are waiting to be sent.

By default, mParticle uploads to Xandr every five minutes.
