## Prerequisites

In order to enable the integration with Arbor, you will need to work with your Arbor technical manager to obtain your API Key and Placement ID for mParticle configuration.

* To sell location data, you must have a minimum of 50,000 daily active users, with 20 data points per user per day, in the United States.
