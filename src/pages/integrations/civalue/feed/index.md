[ciValue](http://www.civalue.com/): Helping Retailers & Suppliers Collaborate to Grow Customer Wallet Share, Omnichannel Personalization, Digital experience, and Data Monetization solutions for Grocery, Drug and Specialty Retailers and their suppliers.

The ciValue feed integration works in conjunction with the ciValue event integration. To receive enrichment data from ciValue, you must first connect an event input. ciValue processes the event data and then will send user data for those customers via the feed integration.

## Enable the Integration

1. Create a ciValue feed configuration in mParticle to produce API key/secret values.
2. Provide these API credentials to your ciValue account manager to connect your ciValue input data to your mParticle feed configuration.

## Supported Event Types

The ciValue feed integration sends user attribute data to enrich mParticle's user profiles. All user attributes are prefaced with `civalue_` to prevent any conflicts or overwriting with your existing user data.

## Supported Identities

### User Identities

* mParticle ID (MPID)

### User Attributes

The values and ranges for various user attributes will depend on how you have configured your data within ciValue. We have listed example values below, but you can check [ciValue's Knowledge Base](https://civalue.freshdesk.com/support/solutions) for more details.
